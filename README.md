# Ruby Practice: CSV Reader CLI Tool
This is a little practice project I made to learn Ruby.  It's a CLI tool that reads CSVs, filtering and processing their fields (string, int, float) based on the "CSV type" given.  Two sample CSV types ('user' & 'business') as well as 'generic' (for processing all fields as string types) are given via the `CSV_TYPES` variable, but others could be added or modified here.
